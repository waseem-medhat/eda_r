# Liver Disease in Indian Patients

This project demonstrates the use of exploratory data analysis (EDA) to search
for interesting information or insights within data. Data visualization and
statistical summaries are the main tools in EDA, and together they can be very
powerful in data analysis.

The data set used in this project contains data on liver disease in Indian
patients^[Data source:
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records)].

The analysis code is written in R and reported via R Markdown. You can inspect
the code for both the analysis and the reporting, or you can [download the PDF
report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waseem-medhat/eda_r/master/liver_disease.pdf).
